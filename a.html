To ensure that the HTML file adheres to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), we'll consider various aspects such as proper text alternatives for images, document structure, and more. Below are some possible WCAG guideline violations and the corresponding changes needed:

1. **Missing Alternative Text for Images**: Images should have `alt` attributes to provide a text alternative for screen readers.

2. **Unclear Headings**: Ensure that the heading structure is meaningful. For instance, starting with `<h1>` is fine, but ensure subsequent headings follow in a hierarchical order.

3. **Semantic Structure**: It's generally a good practice to use semantic tags to help screen readers and other technologies understand the structure of your content.

### Updated HTML with WCAG Fixes

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Page 1</title>
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <h1>Welcome to Page 1</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <p>This is some unique content for page 1.</p>
        <p>Generated at: <time datetime="2023-10-05T14:30">Oct 5, 2023, 2:30 PM</time></p>
        <img src="abc.png" alt="Description of image content"> <!-- Provide meaningful alt text -->
    </main>
    <footer>
        <p>&copy; 2023 Company Name</p>
    </footer>
</body>
</html>
```

### Key Changes:

1. **Image alt Text**: Added an `alt` attribute to the `<img>` tag with a placeholder description. Replace "Description of image content" with an accurate description.

2. **Time Element**: Used the `<time>` tag with a `datetime` attribute to represent machine-readable time.

3. **Structural Semantics**: Added `<header>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>` to enhance the semantic structure of the document.

These changes improve accessibility according to WCAG guidelines, particularly addressing text alternatives for images and improving the semantic structure of the page.
