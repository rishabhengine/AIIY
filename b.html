To ensure the given HTML file adheres to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), I'll address the following potential issues:

1. **Input with No Label:** Every input field should be associated with a label for accessibility purposes. This is important for users who rely on screen readers to understand the function of input fields.

2. **Language Specification:** Specify the primary language of the document in the `<html>` tag for better accessibility and for assistive technologies to interpret the content correctly.

3. **Document Structure:** Include a `<meta charset="UTF-8">` in the `<head>` to define the character set, which ensures special characters are displayed correctly.

Here's the updated HTML file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" lang="en">   
   <head>     
      <title>The World Wide Web Consortium</title>
      <meta charset="UTF-8">     
   </head>   
   <body>     
      <label for="inputText">Enter text:</label>
      <input type="text" id="inputText" name="inputText"> 
   </body> 
</html> 
```

### Changes Made:
- Added a `<label>` element to describe the function of the input field, making sure to use the `for` attribute to link it to the input by its `id`.
- Added a `lang="en"` attribute to the `<html>` tag to specify that the document is in English. Adjust this as necessary for the correct primary language.
- Included a `<meta charset="UTF-8">` element within the `<head>` to define the character encoding. 

These changes address common accessibility requirements per WCAG guidelines for web content. If you have more content or specific elements in your actual file, you may want to perform a thorough review of all elements for compliance.
